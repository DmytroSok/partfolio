              <h2>About</h2>
              <p>
                This project was created as a part of the curriculum for the SolidWorks course at the university. <br><br>
                When I was asked to model a functional mechanical mechanism in SolidWorks, my choice immediately fell on the mechanism 
                of the mechanical wristwatch. It is a very common object on people’s wrists, yet most of the people do not realize how complex it is. 
                In this project, you will see a simplified version of the mechanism due to time constraints and overall complexity. However, 
                I am planning on continuing working on it in the future.<br><br>
                All I initially had was a single webpage explaining the mechanism, no dimensions, no technical specifications or drawings. 
                The final result includes fully defined part drawings, a fully defined assembly, and a motion analysis.<br><br>
                On this page, I will briefly describe the process, but a full-length report is also available for download. 
                You can also see images of the reference mechanism and labeled parts that will be mentioned later in this section.

        <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
                This project aims to recreate the mechanism inside the <strong>wristwatch</strong>. The
                mechanism which does not require any battery and is powered by the elastic force generated by a tightwound mainspring. 
                The spring is a tightly wound coil
                of steel inside the barrel that stores potential energy obtained during the movement of the mechanism or the watch itself. <br><br>
                
                As the mainspring unwinds, the energy is being transferred through the terrain of gears.
                The escape wheel and the fork, also called escapement, is the control mechanism. It allows the release of energy in small, regular increments to ensure the accuracy of
                the mechanism. This is the part that regulates the movement of the gears and makes the hand of the watch move smoother.<br><br>
                The gear train also includes the balance wheel which
                is oscillating at approximatly <strong>5 Hz </strong>. It works with the escapement to divide the stored energy into
                small time intervals, usually measured in seconds. Typically, the preciseness of the balance
                wheel determines the accuracy of the watch.<br><br>

        <h2>Modeling</h2>
          <p>
            The modeling and design of the mechanism was the most challenging part of the project. I did not have a single dimension, 
            which made it incredibly difficult to properly design the gears so they meshed correctly and fit into the mainplate. 
            The decision was made to recreate only the main train of gears—the <strong>controlled movement of the hour, minute, and second hands</strong>. 
            All springs, tiny parts, screws, and other additional mechanisms like winding and dates were excluded. <br><br>

            First, the approximate diameter of the mainplate was chosen based on some research. Then, using <strong>in-context modeling </strong>, 
            the cutouts in the mainplate were created to fit the gears and other parts. The diameters of the gears were selected 
            by trial and error so that they visually look proper according to the reference. Ideally, the gear ratios should have been calculated precisely, 
            but it is out of the scope of this project due to the time restrictions. <br><br>

            The number of teeth on the gears is important to achieve accurate <strong>second-by-second</strong> timing. 
            However, the assumption was made that the gear teeth may not mesh perfectly. Creating ideal gear teeth is complex 
            and requires the use of equations—something I only learned about later. This assumption allowed me to approximate the number of teeth, 
            which worked out very well and saved a tremendous amount of time. <br><br>

            Then the assembly was completed and defined where possible.

        <h2>Motion Analysis</h2>
          <p>
            Following assembly, the motion study was conducted to demonstrate the clock motion.
            A <strong>spring mate</strong> with a stiffness of <em>0.0005 N·mm/deg</em> was placed inside the barrel.
            It was defined to have enough stored energy to rotate the barrel for <strong>200°</strong>. <br><br>

            Then, the <strong>oscillating motor mate</strong> was placed on the balance wheel with a rate of <strong>5 Hz</strong>,
            and a <strong>contact mate</strong> between the balance wheel and the fork was defined to make the balance wheel push the fork,
            which restricted the motion of the escape wheel.<br><br>

            During the placement of the mates, some challenges were encountered.
            First, it was necessary to choose the proper orientation for the balance wheel and fork so that they touched
            with every oscillation. Because of the contact mate, if it was not oriented perfectly from the beginning, the simulation did not work.<br><br>

            Another issue was sizing the fork properly to restrict the escape wheel's motion. 
            After some trial and error, these problems were resolved, and the desired results were achieved.

        <h2>Conclution</h2>
          <p>
              This project brought together everything that has been learned throughout the course and
              gave an opportunity to apply this knowledge to replicate an existing mechanical watch
              mechanism. The task to design the mechanical watch based on a real-life mechanism provided a
              challenging experience, one that was closely transferable to a real engineering environment.
              From the early stages of research and planning to the final stages of testing and evaluation, the
              project followed a consistent engineering design process. <br><br>
              By completing the entire project in SolidWorks software, the project highlighted the
              ability to visualize and analyze complex designs. The software made it possible to model a
              detailed and precise version of a mechanical watch, create the movement, and conduct a motion
              study.<br><br>
              As the project progressed, it was obvious that designs often don’t work perfectly the first
              time. Many elements did not work properly, and frequent adjustments were made due to time
              constraints, missing dimensions, and the complexity of the model. Assumptions on dimensions
              and the look of the parts had to be made, as well as critical thinking was required to create the
              proper motion study.<br><br>
              One of the most significant challenges was the complexity of the watch’s mechanism
              itself. Mechanical watches involve many tiny, interconnected parts that must move together. In
              addition, a lack of any dimensions made it difficult to achieve the precise movement. These
              challenges were resolved by researching, making assumptions, and working consistently on the
              project. As a result, the final motion study captured the motion of the mechanical watch’s
              mechanism, presenting a close approximation of the real watch movement. <br><br>
               <strong>It was a success!</strong>
